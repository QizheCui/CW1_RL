# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation

This repository hosts the code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `tic-tac-toe.ipynb`. The notebook includes the basic setup of the Tic-Tac-Toe board and the initialization of various player types: RandomPlayer, WinningMovePlayer, ThandPlayer, and HumanPlayer. Additionally, it features the training of two types of reinforcement learning agents: a Temporal Difference (TD) Agent and a Q-Agent. The performance of these agents is evaluated against different types of players, and they are also set up to play against human players.
